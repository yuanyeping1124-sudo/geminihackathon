# Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise overview

Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise, which are products in the
[Gemini for Google Cloud](/gemini/docs/overview) portfolio, offer
AI-powered assistance to help your development team build, deploy, and operate
applications throughout the software development lifecycle. Note that these
products are separate from
[Gemini Code Assist for individuals](https://codeassist.google).

You can use Gemini Code Assist in
[supported IDEs](/gemini/docs/codeassist/supported-languages#supported_ides),
such as VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, or Android Studio, for AI-powered
coding assistance in
[many popular languages](/gemini/docs/codeassist/supported-languages).
You can get code completions as you write your code, generate full
functions or code blocks from comments, generate unit tests, and get help with
debugging, understanding, and documenting your code.

Gemini Code Assist provides contextualized responses to your
prompts, including
[source citations](/gemini/docs/discover/works#how-when-gemini-cites-sources)
regarding which documentation and code samples
Gemini Code Assist used to generate its responses.

[Learn how and when
Gemini for Google Cloud uses your data](/gemini/docs/discover/data-governance).

As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud products can
generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you validate
all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it. For more
information, see
[Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI](/gemini/docs/discover/responsible-ai).

Gemini Code Assist provides citation information when it
directly quotes at length from another source, such as existing open source code.
For more information, see
[How and when Gemini cites sources](/gemini/docs/discover/works#how-when-gemini-cites-sources).

## Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise editions overview

The following section compares the Gemini Code Assist Standard
and Enterprise editions.

The Standard edition offers AI coding assistance, with enterprise-grade
security, for building and running applications. The Enterprise edition offers
