## Encapsulation Boundary

The gemini-cli-docs skill maintains a clear boundary between its **public interface** (what external skills interact with) and **private implementation** (internal storage and logic).

### Public Interface (Accessible to External Skills)

**What external skills can access:**

- **SKILL.md** - Usage documentation and guidance (how to use the skill)
- **references/** - Technical guides, workflows, and best practices (how the skill works)
- **Public API** - Programmatic access via functions:
  - `find_document()` - Natural language search
  - `resolve_doc_id()` - Convert doc_id to content
  - `get_docs_by_tag()` - Tag-based filtering
  - `search_by_keywords()` - Keyword search
  - `get_document_section()` - Section extraction
  - `detect_drift()` - Change detection
  - `cleanup_drift()` - Drift cleanup

**How external skills invoke the skill:**

- Natural language: "Find documentation about checkpointing"
- Programmatic: `from gemini_docs_api import find_document`
- File paths: Never - external skills use API, not file paths

### Private Implementation (Internal to Skill)

**What is NOT exposed to external skills:**

- **canonical/** - Official documentation storage (internal database)
  - `geminicli-com/` - Scraped docs from geminicli.com
  - `index.yaml` - Metadata index (accessed via API only)

- **scripts/** - Implementation scripts (use via API commands, never accessed directly)
  - Core scripts (scraping, discovery, resolution)
  - Management scripts (index maintenance, cleanup)
  - Validation scripts (drift detection, metadata auditing)
  - Maintenance scripts (log cleanup, cache clearing)

- **Internal APIs** - Not exposed:
  - `index_manager.py` - Low-level index operations
  - `scrape_docs.py` - Scraping implementation
  - `doc_resolver.py` - Resolution logic

### Why This Boundary Matters

**Encapsulation benefits:**

1. **Implementation hiding** - Internal structure can change without breaking external skills
2. **Consistent access** - All external skills use same API regardless of internal changes
3. **Maintainability** - Updates to canonical storage don't require changes to external skills
4. **Resilience** - Doc references survive file moves/renames (via alias resolution)
5. **Clean API** - External skills never need to know file paths, structure, or implementation details

### Example: Discovery Without Knowing Implementation

**External skill:**

```python
docs = find_document("checkpointing session save")
# Returns results, never needs to know:
# - Where canonical/ directory is located
# - How index.yaml is structured
# - How document metadata is extracted
# - How file paths are resolved
```

**Internal (hidden from external skills):**

- Reads index.yaml
- Matches against keywords and tags
- Ranks by relevance
- Resolves file paths
- Loads content if needed

External skill only sees the result, never the implementation details.

## Dependencies

### For Agentic Tools (Claude Code, etc.)

**Before running scripts, check dependencies:**

```bash
python plugins/google-ecosystem/skills/gemini-cli-docs/scripts/setup/check_dependencies.py
```

### Required Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PyYAML | >=6.0 | YAML parsing for index.yaml |
| requests | >=2.28 | HTTP requests for scraping |
| beautifulsoup4 | >=4.11 | HTML parsing |
| markdownify | >=0.11 | HTML to Markdown conversion |
| filelock | >=3.0 | File locking for concurrent access |

### Optional Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spacy | >=3.7 | Keyword extraction (auto-installed) |
| en_core_web_sm | N/A | spaCy English model |

### Python Version

- **Recommended:** Python 3.13 (required for spaCy operations)
- **Minimum:** Python 3.11

---

## Keyword Extraction Strategy

### Automatic Keyword Extraction

Keywords are extracted automatically during index refresh using spaCy NLP:

1. **Noun chunks** - Multi-word noun phrases (e.g., "model routing", "session management")
2. **Named entities** - Proper nouns and technical terms
3. **Filtering** - Remove stopwords, short words, generic terms

### Manual Keyword Override

For documents requiring specific keywords, add to frontmatter:

```yaml
---
keywords:
  - checkpointing
  - session
  - save state
  - restore
---
```

## Source: llms.txt

Unlike sitemap.xml-based scraping (used for Claude docs), Gemini CLI documentation uses **llms.txt** format:

- **URL:** `https://geminicli.com/llms.txt`
- **Format:** Markdown links `[Title](URL)`
- **Parsing:** Extract URLs via regex pattern `\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)`

### llms.txt vs Sitemap.xml

| Aspect | llms.txt | sitemap.xml |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format | Markdown links | XML structure |
| Parsing | Regex extraction | XML parser |
| Categories | Inferred from URL path | Explicit in structure |
| Titles | Included in link text | Not included |

---

## Index Structure

### index.yaml Format

```yaml
geminicli-com-docs-checkpointing:
  url: https://geminicli.com/docs/checkpointing
  title: "Checkpointing"
  description: "Save and restore session state"
  path: geminicli-com/docs/checkpointing.md
  domain: geminicli.com
  category: docs
  keywords:
    - checkpointing
    - session
    - save
    - restore
  tags:
    - cli
    - session-management
  content_hash: sha256:abc123...
  last_fetched: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

### doc_id Generation

doc_id is generated from URL:

```
https://geminicli.com/docs/checkpointing
                    ↓
geminicli-com-docs-checkpointing
```

Rules:
- Replace `.` with `-` (domain separator)
- Replace `/` with `-` (path separator)
- Lowercase all characters
- Remove trailing `-`
