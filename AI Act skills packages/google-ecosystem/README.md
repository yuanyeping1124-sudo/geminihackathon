# Google Ecosystem Plugin

Comprehensive Google Gemini CLI ecosystem plugin for Claude Code. Provides official documentation management, Claude-to-Gemini integration agents, meta-skills for Gemini CLI configuration, and quick integration commands.

## Philosophy: Claude Orchestrates, Gemini Executes

This plugin enables Claude to delegate tasks to Gemini CLI where Gemini excels:

- **Sandbox Isolation**: Execute risky commands safely
- **Checkpointing**: Experimental refactors with instant rollback
- **Large Context**: Analyze 100K+ token codebases (Gemini has 1M+ context)
- **Interactive Shells**: Handle TUI commands (vim, git rebase -i)
- **Second Opinions**: Independent validation from another AI

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install google-ecosystem@claude-code-plugins
```

## Quick Start

### Get a Second Opinion

```text
/google-ecosystem:gemini-second-opinion Is this architecture correct?
```

### Analyze Code Securely

```text
/google-ecosystem:gemini-analyze src/auth.ts security
```

### Execute Risky Command Safely

```text
/google-ecosystem:gemini-sandbox npm install unknown-package
```

### Quick Query

```text
/google-ecosystem:gemini-query Explain async/await in JavaScript
```

## Architecture

### Pure Delegation

All meta-skills delegate to `gemini-cli-docs` for official documentation:

```text
gemini-checkpoint-management
        │
        ▼
    gemini-cli-docs ──► canonical/ (scraped docs)
        │
        ▼
    Official Gemini CLI Documentation
```

### Hook Detection

The plugin includes hooks that detect Gemini CLI questions and suggest the appropriate skill:

- High-confidence triggers: `gemini-cli`, `geminicli.com`, `memport`, `policy-engine`
- Context-aware triggers: `checkpointing`, `extensions`, `MCP` (when Gemini context exists)

## Version

**v1.2.0** - Workspace bridging expansion with 3 exploration/sync agents, 4 planning commands, 5 new skills for workspace architecture, memory sync, and meta-tooling (TOML commands, policy engine).
