Conduct a comprehensive GDPR compliance assessment.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Required Skills

Load these skills:

- `data-classification` - Personal data categorization

### Step 2: Spawn Privacy Officer Agent

Spawn the `privacy-officer` agent with the following prompt:

```text

Perform the following assessments:

1. Data Mapping
   - Identify all personal data collected
   - Categorize data (standard vs special category)
   - Map data flows (collection, processing, storage, sharing)
   - Identify controllers and processors
   - Document international transfers

2. Lawful Basis Assessment
   - Determine lawful basis for each processing activity
   - Validate consent mechanisms (if applicable)
   - Conduct Legitimate Interest Assessment (if applicable)

3. DPIA Determination
   - Assess if DPIA is required
   - If required, conduct risk assessment
   - Recommend mitigations for identified risks

4. Data Subject Rights
   - Assess implementation of all rights
   - Identify gaps in rights fulfillment
   - Recommend improvements

5. Privacy by Design
   - Evaluate data minimization
   - Assess purpose limitation
   - Review storage limitation
   - Check transparency measures

6. Documentation Review
   - Privacy notices
   - Processing records (Article 30)
   - Data protection policies

Provide a complete GDPR assessment with:
- Compliance score by area
- Gap analysis with priorities
- Remediation roadmap
- Evidence requirements
```

### Step 3: Generate Assessment Report

Ensure the report includes:

- Executive summary with overall compliance rating
- Detailed findings by GDPR article
- Prioritized remediation plan
- Timeline for compliance

## Example Usage

```bash
# Assess a customer data processing system
/compliance-planning:assess-gdpr "customer relationship management system processing EU customer data"

# Assess a marketing platform
/compliance-planning:assess-gdpr "email marketing platform with subscriber consent management"

# Assess an e-commerce site
/compliance-planning:assess-gdpr "e-commerce website serving EU customers with payment processing"
```
